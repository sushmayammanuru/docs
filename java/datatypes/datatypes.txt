In Java all variables are declared before its use.

Every assignment should be checked by the compiler for compatibility.

So it is also a strong typed programming language
    - every variable, method and expression is of some type.
    - each and every datatype is clearly defined.

Java is not considered as pure OOP language.
    - Due to primitive datatypes which are not objects.
    - Some OOP's concept are not satisfied by Java

What are the datatypes in Java?
    - Numeric and Non Numeric

What are Numeric datatypes?
    - Further divided into two types: Integral and Floating point

    - Integral datatype has byte, short, int and long
    - Floating point datatype has float and double

What are Non Numeric datatypes?
    - Boolean and Char

Except Boolean and Char datatypes, remaining datatypes are signed datatypes, because we can save both positive and negative numbers.

Explain about Integral datatype?
    - BYTE:  range is -128 to 127
    - SHORT: range is -2^15 to (2^15 - 1)
    - INT :  range is -2^31 to (2^31 - 1)
    - LONG:  range is -2^63 to (2^63 - 1)

    - The default value for these datatypes is 0.

    Syntax:

    byte a=98; //valid
    byte a=128; //invalid and error is "incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from int to byte"

Explain about Floating datatype?
    - FLOAT: Single precision, 0.0F is default value

    Syntax:

    float f1= 234.5f

    -DOUBLE: Double precision, 0.0d is default value

    Syntax:
    double d1=12.3

Boolean: For performing logical and decision making operations.

Char: In old languages like C and C++, char is based upon ASCII values.
      -To represent these 256 characters 8 bits are enough, hencesize of char in old language is 1 byte.
      -But java is UNICODE based and the number of UNICODE characters are >256 and <+65536, hence to represent these many characters 8 bits
       are not enough, compulsory we should go for 16 bits, due to this the size of char in Java is 2bytes

Null: Null is the default value for object reference, and it can't apply for primitive datatypes, if we are trying to assign
      null value for primitive datatypes then we will get compile time error.
