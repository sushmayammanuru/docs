 Scope
	Scope determines the accessibility of variables , objects, and functions
	from different parts of the code.
javaScipt has 3 types of scopes
	Global scope
	function scope
	block scope
--
Global scope
	In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.
	A variable declared outside of a function, becomes Global,
	automatically Global
		If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared,
		It will automatically become a Global variable
--
Function scope
	Variable defines inside a function with let and const types are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
--
block scope
	Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only  Global scope and function scope.
	ES6 introduced  two important new javaScipt keywords : let and const .
	These two keywords provide block scope in javaScipt
	Variable  declared inside a {} block with let and const types cannot be accessed from outside the block.

What is the reason beyond introducing let and const in ES6?
	Before introducing let and const variables, var is used to  declare the variables within the function and block scope.
	If we are declaring  variable with var type in function and block scope , we can access the variables outside  of the function.
	This is for security purpose/accessibility issue .That is the reason let and const are introduced in ES6.
	So if you want to declare  a variable within the function  or block level then use let and const.
	If Declare the variable inside the function or block with let and const we
	we cant access  outside the function or block.
