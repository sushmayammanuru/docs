why do we need loops?
	To excute the logic repeatedly.
What are the types of loops?
	for	:
		loops through a block of code a number of times.
	for/in :
		loops through the properties of an object.
	for/of :
		loops through the values of an array.
	while :
		loops through a block of code if the specified condition is true.
		If the condition is true then only excutes  the block of code.
	do/while :
		loops through a block of code if the specified condition is true
		it will excutes the block of code at least once and checks the
		condition.

For:
	Syntax:
	for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
	//write your code here...., may be single line or 100 lines
	//getEmployee();
	//It will excutes multiple lines based upon the condition.
	}
	Example:
	for(let i =0;i<10;i++){
		console.log("This is my logic whicj=h i want to excute 10times"+i");
	}
	const employees = ["steven","alexa","lex"];
	for(let i =0 ;i<employees.length;i++){
	console.log(employess[i]);
	}
	//array index-5 length-6;
	//index-length-1;
==
What is for In?
	for In statement loops through the properties of an object.
Syntax :
	for (property in object){
		// code block to be excuted
	}
Example:
	function forLoop4(){
	const employee = {empId : "101",firstName : "Sushma",lastName :"yammanuru" }
	let text = "";
	for (let property in employee){
		text += employee[property];"<br>";
	}
	document.getElementById("employee").inner HTML = text;
	}
--
What is forOf?
	forOf statements loops through the values of an iterable array.
Syntax:
	for(values of iterable){
		//block of code to be excuted
	}
Example:
	function forOf(){
		const employees =["sudha","pavan",sushma];
		let text = "";
		for(let employee of employees){
			text += employee + "<br>";
		}
		document.getElementById("employee").inner HTML = text;
	}
