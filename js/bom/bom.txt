what is BOM?
	The Browser object model (BOM) allows javascript to "talk to" the browser.
	there are no official standards for the browser object model(BOM).
	since modern browsers have implemented (almost) the name methods and properties.
	for javascript interactivity,it is often reffered to as methods and
	properties of the BOM.

what is Window Object? 
	The window object is supported by all browsers.It represents the browser's
	window.
	All global javascript objects,functions,and variables automatically become
	members of  the window object.

	global functions are methods of the window object.
	All Objects are childs of the window object.

Even the document object (of the HTML DOM)is a property of the window object;

window.document.getElementById(Header);
is the same as:
document.getElementById("Header");
