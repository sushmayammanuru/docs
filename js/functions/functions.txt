What is a function?
	function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
	function is excutes when "something" invokes it(calls it).
syntax:
	function <return_type> function_name(
	<parameter1, parameter2 , parameter3,......parametern>){
	//block of code [sometime will write 100 lines of code]
	//designed to perform  a particular task
	<return value>
	}
Example:
	function boolean createEmployee(firstName, lastName, phoneNO){
	//block of code [sometime will write 100 lines of code]
	//designed to perform  a particular task
	}
	parameters are  listed inside the parenthesis() in the function defination.
	arguments are the values received by the function when it is  invoked.
	Inside the function, the arguments (parameters) behave local variables.
===
What is firstName invocation?
	the code inside the function will excute when "something" invokes(calls)
	the function.
Example:
	createEmployee("ravi","kumar",9912456789);

what  is return statement?
	when function reaches the "return" statement, It will returns the value to the
	caller function and it will stop  excuting the function.
	we have to write return statement at the end of the method.
Syntax:
	function functionName (){
	// block of code
	return something;
	}
	Example:
	function addition(n1 , n2){
		let res n1 , n2;
		return res;
	}
===
why functions ?
	We can reuse code: define the code once ,and use it many times.
	you can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce
	different results

Functions used as variable Values
Syntax :
	let variableNmae = functionName();
	Example:
	let  variableName = addition(10 , 20 );
--
Local variables?
	variables declared within a function, become LOCAL to the function.
	local variables can only be accessed from within the function.
	Since local variables are only recognised inside their functions
	Variables with the same name can be used in different functions.
	local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the
	function is completed.
	Syntax:
	function functionName(){
		let n1,
		let n2,
		let res;
		//block of code.
		return res;
	}
		Example:
		function addition(){
			let n1 = 10;
			let n2 = 30;
			let res = n1 + n2;
			// block of code
			retutn res;
		}
