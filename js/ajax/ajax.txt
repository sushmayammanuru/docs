What is Synchronous?
    - Executing the functions or code one by one/line by line is called Synchronous.
    - Example:
        Booking a movie ticket from one counter.

What is Asynchronous?
    - Executing the functions or code parallelly is called asynchronous.
    - Example:
        Booking the movie from multiple counters.

What is AJAX?
    - AJAX is not a programming language, it is a part of javascript.
    - AJAX is a technique for accessing web servers(Tomcat) from a webpage(Chrome)
    - AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML.
    - Javascript is synchronous by default. 
	- By default javascript won't wait for to get response from the server.
    - By using AJAX we can implement asynchronous mechanism in javascript.

What is the usage of AJAX?
    - By using AJAX we can perform CRUD operations.
        - We can read data from a web server.
        - We can send data to a web server.
        - We can update a webpage without reloading the page.
        - We can delete the records from the database.

How AJAX works?
    - AJAX allows webpages to be updated asynchronously by exchanging data with
	a web server the scenes.
    This means that it is possible to update parts of a webpage, without reloading the whole page.
    - AJAX is a misleading name. AJAX applications might use XML to transport data, but it is equally common
    to transport data as plain text or JSON text.

    Browser [Chrome]    <-->    Internet    <-->    Web Server [Tomcat]
    1, 2, 7, 8                  3, 6                4, 5

    1. An event occurs in a webpage (the page is loaded, a button is clicked)
    2. An XMLHttpRequest object is created by javascript.
    3. The XMLHttpRequest object sends a request to a web server.
    4. The server process the request.
    5. The server prepares the response object.
    6. The server sends a response object back to the webpage.
    7. The response is read by javascript.
    8. Proper action(like page update) is performed by javascript.

How to get XMLHttpRequest object?
    1. Create an XMLHttpRequest object.
        Syntax:
            let xhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();

    2. Open request to a server.
        Syntax:
            xhttp.open("method_name","http://hostname:portname/appname/service_url", sync/async type);
        
        Example:
            xhttp.open("GET", "departments_url", true);
            
            xhttp.open("POST", "departments_url");

    3. Send request to a server
        Syntax:
            xhttp.send();
            xhttp.send(request_body);

        Example:
            xhttp.send();

            xhttp.send("'departmentId':'270',
                        'departmentName':'HR'
                        'managerId':'200'
                        'locationId':'1700'");

    4. Define a call back function.
        - A callback function is passed as a parameter to another function.
            Syntax:
                xhttp.onload = function(){
                    //process the response object
                }
				
What is Access Across Domains?

What is CORS Policy Issue?
	For security reasons, modern browsers do not allow access across domains.
	This means that both the web page and the XML file it tries to load, must
	be located on the same server.
	
	Example: In aadhar server, all person pics are located at aadhar domain.
	If you want to use the aadhar example on one of your own web pages, then 
	persons	pic you load must be located on your own server.
	
	Example: 			aadhar		aadhar.com
		Enabled for : 	phonepe		phonepe.com
						gpay		gpay.com
						jio			jio.com
						USA			usembassy.com
						
		Restricted for: Pakistan	rupe.com
		
What are XMLHttpRequest Object Methods?
	- Open: This method is used to open the object to request the server.
	- Send: This method is used to send the request.
	
Is Javascript asynchronous by default?
	- NO, javascript is always synchronous
	
XML or JSON?
	- Carrying the data to and  from the server to browser we can use XML and JSON
	  JSON is understandable, shorter and faster than XML.
	  
What is XMLHttpRequest?
	- XMLHttpRequest is used for asynchronous communication between browser and server.
	  Sends the data from the server to browser.
	  Receives the data from the server to browser.
	  Updates the data on webpage withoout reloading.
	  
Properties of XMLHttpRequest?
	- onreadystatechange:
		It is called whenever readystate attribute changes.
		It must not be used with synchronous requests.
	- readystate:
		represents the state of the request. It ranges from 0 to 4.
		holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.
			0: request not initiated
			1: server connection established
			2: request received
			3: processing request
			4: request finished and response is ready.
			
		responseText: returns response as text.
		responseXML: returns response as XML.
		
Methods of XMLHttpRequest?
	- open(method, URL): opens the request specifying get or post method an url.
	
	- open(method, URL, async): Same as above but specifies asynchronous or not.
	
	- open(method, URL, async, username, password): same as above but specifies username and password
	
	- send(): sends the request.
	
	- send(string): send post request.
	
	-setRequestHeader(header,value): It adds request headers.
	
What is the difference between onreadystatechange and readystate?
