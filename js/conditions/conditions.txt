Why we need to use conditional statements?
	Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on
	different conditions.
--
what are the conditional statements?
	if
	ifelse
	else-if ladder
	switch case
--
What is if statement?
	if the specified condition is true, then only if block of code will excute.
	Syntax:
		if(condition){
		//true condition block of code
		}
	Example:
		if(age>=18){
			// write a logic for applying voter card
		}
--
What is else statement?
if the specified condition is false , then only else block of code will excute.
Syntax:
	if(condition){
	 //condition true block of code
	}
	else{
		//condition not true block of code
	}
Example:
	if(age >= 18){
		// write  A logic for applying a votercard
	}else{
	 //write a logic to show information to the user.
	}
what is else if statement?
	else-if statement is used to specify a new condition.
	if the condition is true , if will excute if block.
	if the condition is false , it will excute else block.
Syntax:
	if(condition1){
		//if condition1 true block of code.
	} else if (condition2){
	 //else if condition2 true block of code
	}else {
		//if all conditions are not true block of code.
	}
Example:
	if(class<=5){
		//go to primary scholl
	}else if (class<10){
		//go to high school
	}else if (class<=12) {
		// go to inter college
	}else if(class<=15){
		//go to degree college
	} else {
		// go to pg college
	}
What is switch case?
if you want to check more conditions [more than 4], its better to use switch
instead of else if ladder.

differece between else if ladder and switch?

else-if ladder taking a time to process and excuting . it firstly check the each 
condition if the condition is true .That code of block will be excute  after
it wont check the other  conditions.It checks the  condition until the condition
is true.

Switch case it only checks the particular condition which is matched that case of
 code block will be excuted then breaks the condition and breaksout from the condition
 it wont check before conditions and after conditions also.Thats why most of them
 prefer  switchcase than else -if ladder. its taking less time consumption.
