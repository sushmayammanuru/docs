conditional statements in javascript?
	Conditional statements in JavaScript allow you to execute specific blocks of 
	code based on conditions. There are several methods that can be used to
	perform conditional statements in JavaScript, 
	including:
if Statement:
	The if statement is used to evaluate a particular condition. If the 
	condition holds true, the associated code block is executed.
Syntax:	
	if (condition) 
		{
			// If the condition is met,
			// code will get executed.
		}

if-else Statement: 
	The if-else statement will perform some action for a specific condition. 
	If the condition is true, the first block of code will be executed, 
	otherwise the second block of code will be executed.
Syntax:
	if (condition1) {
	// Executes when condition1 is true
		}
	else {
		// Executes when condition1 is false
}
else if Statement:
	The else if statement in JavaScript allows handling multiple possible 
	conditions and outputs, evaluating more than two options based on whether
	the conditions are true or false. 
Syntax:
	if (condition1) {
		// Code for condition1
	}	
	else if (condition2) 	
	{
		// Code for condition2
	}
	else
	{
		// Code for all other cases
	}
switch Statement: 
	The switch statement may be a more preferred option when dealing with many
	conditions. 
Syntax:
	switch (expression) {
	case value1:
		statement1;
    break;
	case value2:
		statement2;
    break;
  ...
   case valueN:
		statementN;
   break;
   default:
    statementDefault;
}
